Description: nsxramlclient
        =============
        
        This Python based client for NSX for vSphere 6.x gets its API structure
        information (e.g. URLs, parameters, schema, etc.) from a RAML file which
        describes the NSX for vSphere REST API. It has been developed and tested
        for use with VMware NSX for vSphere 6.x.
        
        The latest version of the NSX for vSphere 6.x RAML file can be found at
        http://github.com/vmware/nsxraml
        
        NOTE: Please read the bellow Version information. The 2.0 Version of nsxramlclient is needed to support the
        new format of the nsxraml spec on http://github.com/vmware/nsxraml that introduced a breaking change in the
        way schemas are handled.
        If you are using the 1.x version of nsxramlclient you will need to use the 6.1.4, 6.1.6 or 6.2.2 versions of
        the nsx raml spec.
        In the 2.0 version the method ``extract_resource_body_schema`` was replaced with ``extract_resource_body_example``

        Version History
        ===============
        
        Version 2.0
        -----------
        
        This version of nsxramlclient is needed to support the new format of the
        nsxraml spec on http://github.com/vmware/nsxraml that introduced a
        breaking change in the way schemas are handled. In the new NSX-v RAML
        spec schemas are now real schemas that can be used to check the
        correctness of your XML document. In the earlier versions the schema was
        used to return an XML example as a python Dict. The new way of
        retrieving the XML example dict is by using the new method introduced in
        the 2.0 version named ``extract_resource_body_example``
        
        Version 1.0.4
        -------------
        
        This release introduces new helper methods:
        
        ``read_all_pages``: This Method reads all pages from the API Get for the
        ['virtualWires', 'pagedEdgeList'] displayNames. This e.g. helps to
        collect all logical switches present in the system without having to
        know the needed page file size
        
        ``normalize_list_return``: There are API calls in NSX-v were you are
        getting a None object if no Object is present, a Dict type when only one
        Object is present, and a List of Dicts when more than one Object is
        present. E.g. for the retrieval of logical switches. When passing the
        API return to this function it will normalize the return to be a list.
        If the input is a None Object (no Object exists in NSX-v) an empty list
        is return. When one Object is found, a List with the one Dict is
        returned, when the input is a list, it is returned back unmodified

        How to install nsxramlclient
        ============================
        
        The following install instructions are based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but
        installations on other Linux distributions or on the Apple MacOS should
        be relatively similar and should be familiar to those familiar with
        Python.
        
        Check whether pip is installed
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip --version
        
        If pip is not installed, install it with apt-get or the package manager
        appropriate for your operating system.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
        
        Now you can use pip to install the nsx raml client
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo pip install nsxramlclient
        
        In some cases the installation may fail because of missing dependencies.
        You may see the following message and will have to install the required
        packages
        
        ::
        
            ERROR: /bin/sh: 1: xslt-config: not found
            ** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed **
        
        This example shows installing the dependencies using the apt package
        manager and the apt-get command. Once dependencies are installed you can
        retry the pip installation of the nsxramlclient shown above.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev
        
        Also sometimes you might run into the issue of missing Python OpenSSL on
        your Ubuntu machine. In this case you will see the following error
        message when importing nsxramlclient.client:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            ImportError: No module named OpenSSL.SSL
        
        if you encounter this, simply install the package python-openssl
        manually:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo apt-get install python-openssl
        
        Examples on how to use nsxramlclient
        ====================================
        
        Create a session object
        -----------------------
        
        It is required to create a session object with which you will interact
        with the NSX REST API. This session object will then expose the create,
        read, update and delete (CRUD) methods of each NSX object as well as
        some helper methods that will be useful.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from nsxramlclient.client import NsxClient
        
            nsxraml_file = '/raml/nsxraml/nsxvapiv614.raml'
            nsxmanager = 'nsxmanager.invalid.org'
            nsx_username = 'admin'
            nsx_password = 'vmware'
        
            client_session = NsxClient(nsxraml_file, nsxmanager, nsx_username, 
                                       nsx_password, debug=False)
        
        The NsxClient class has the following initialization parameters:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            """
            :param raml_file: 
            This mandatory parameter is the RAML file used as the basis of all URL 
            compositions. It allows the client to extract the body schema and convert the schema into python dictionaries.
        
            :param nsxmanager: 
            This mandatory parameter is either the hostname or IP Address of the NSX Manager appliance.
        
            :param nsx_username: 
            This mandatory parameter is the username on NSX Manager used for authentication to the NSX REST API running on the NSX Manager.
        
            :param nsx_password: 
            This mandatory parameter is the password of the user used for authentication to the NSX REST API running on the NSX Manager.
        
            :param debug: Optional: 
            If set to True, the client will print extensive HTTP session information to stdout. 
            Default: False
        
            :param verify: Optional: 
            If set to True, the client will strictly verify the certificate passed by NSX Manager. It is recommmended in all production environments to use signed certificates for the NSX REST API. Please refer to the NSX for vSphere documentation for information on how to convert from the self-signed certificate to a signed certificate.
            Default: False
        
            :param suppress_warnings: Optional: 
            If set to True, the client will print out a warning if NSX Manager uses a self signed certificate. 
            Default: True
        
            :return: Returns a NsxClient Session Object
            """
        
        After you initialized a session object you have access to the following
        methods:
        
        -  create: Sends a HTTP POST to NSX Manager. More details will follow
           later in this readme.
        
        -  read: Sends a HTTP GET to NSX Manager
        
        -  update: Sends a HTTP PUT to NSX Manager
        
        -  delete: Sends a HTTP DELETE to NSX Manager
        
        -  view\_response: Each of the above methods returns a Python
           OrderedDictionary with the HTTP Status code, location header, NSX
           Object Id, eTag Header and Body. This method outputs the OrderedDict
           in human readable text to stdout.
        
        -  extract\_resource\_body\_schema: DEPRECATION WARING: Use the method
           extract\_resource\_body\_schema. In future version this will be
           removed This method will retrieve the body schema from the RAML File
           (if the method has a body schema like most create methods), and will
           return a template python dictionary that can be used to construct
           subsequent API calls.
        
        -  extract\_resource\_body\_example: This method will retrieve the body
           example from the RAML File (if the method has a body example like
           most create methods), and will return a template python dictionary
           that can be used to construct subsequent API calls.
        
        -  view\_resource\_body\_schema: This method retrieves the body schema
           from the RAML file and outputs it to stdout as a pretty printed XML
           document.
        
        -  view\_resource\_body\_example: This method retrieves the body example
           from the RAML file and outputs it to stdout as a pretty printed XML
           document.
        
        -  view\_body\_dict: This method takes a body dictionary (any python
           dictionary), and outputs it in a human readable format to stdout.
        
        -  view\_resource\_display\_names: This method outputs displayNames and
           descriptions of all resources in the RAML File with their associated
           URI & query parameters, additional headers, and what methods are
           supported.
        
        Use of the create, read, update and delete methods
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [1]: client_session.read('vCenterStatus')
            Out[2]: OrderedDict([('status', 200), ('body', {'vcConfigStatus': {'connected': 'true', 'lastInventorySyncTime': '1440444721014'}}), ('location', None), ('objectId', None), ('Etag', None)])
        
        The create, read, update and delete methods return a Python OrderedDict
        with the following key/value pairs: - status: The HTTP status code
        returned as an integer. - body: The response body returned as a dict. If
        no body was returned the response will be ``None`` - location: If a
        location header is returned, this value will be the location URL as a
        string otherwise it will return ``None`` - objectId: If a location
        header is returned, the value of objectId will be the last part of the
        location url as a string otherwise it will return ``None`` - Etag: If a
        Etag header is returned, the value of Etag will be the content of the
        Etag header returned otherwise it will return ``None``
        
        To output the response in a human readable format when working in an
        interactive session use the ``view_response`` method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [3]: response = client_session.read('vCenterStatus')
            In [4]: client_session.view_response(response)
            HTTP status code:
            200
        
            HTTP Body Content:
            {'vcConfigStatus': {'connected': 'true',
                                'lastInventorySyncTime': '1440445281484'}}
        
        If a method needs a URI parameter to work, the NSX RAML Client will
        compose the URL based on the base URL, parent and child method URL and
        the supplied URI parameter. To supply a URI parameter, add a URI
        parameter dict to the call. You can supply multiple URI parameters in
        the call if needed.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [5]: response = client_session.read('vdnSegmentPool', 
                                                   uri_parameters={'segmentPoolId': '2'})
            In [6]: client_session.view_response(response)
            HTTP status code:
            200
        
            HTTP Body Content:
            {'segmentRange': {'begin': '5000',
                              'end': '10000',
                              'id': '2',
                              'name': 'legacy'}}
        
        If a method supports one or more query parameters, you can supply those
        optional query parameters in your request, and the NSX RAML Client will
        add the query parameter for you. To use this pass a query parameter dict
        to the call:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [7]: response = client_session.read('nwfabricStatus', 
                                                   query_parameters_dict={'resource': 
                                                                          'domain-c1632'})
            In [8]: client_session.view_response(response)
            HTTP status code:
            200
            .... truncated for brevity ....
        
        It is possible to use URI and query parameters concurrently in any call
        and add as many as the resource specifies.
        
        If a resource requires a body to be supplied with data the body can be
        composed in the following way:
        
        Check what the body of a call needs to look like by retrieving it out of
        the RAML file, and displaying it to stdout using
        ``view_resource_body_example``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [9]: client_session.view_resource_body_example('logicalSwitches', 'create')
        
            <virtualWireCreateSpec>
                <name>mandatory</name>
                <description/>
                <tenantId>mandatory</tenantId>
                <controlPlaneMode>mandatory</controlPlaneMode>
            </virtualWireCreateSpec>
        
        It is possible to create a template python dictionary using
        ``extract_resource_body_example`` and display the output structure in a
        human readable format to stdout:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [10]: new_ls = client_session.extract_resource_body_example('logicalSwitches', 
                                                                          'create')
        
            In [11]: client_session.view_body_dict(new_ls)
            {'virtualWireCreateSpec': {'controlPlaneMode': 'mandatory',
                                       'description': None,
                                       'name': 'mandatory',
                                       'tenantId': 'mandatory'}}
        
        It is possible to change any of the values in the dictionary with the
        data to be sent to the API:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [12]: new_ls['virtualWireCreateSpec']['controlPlaneMode'] = 'UNICAST_MODE'
            In [13]: new_ls['virtualWireCreateSpec']['name'] = 'TestLogicalSwitch1'
            In [14]: new_ls['virtualWireCreateSpec']['tenantId'] = 'Tenant1'
        
            In [15]: client_session.view_body_dict(new_ls)
            {'virtualWireCreateSpec': {'controlPlaneMode': 'UNICAST_MODE',
                                       'description': None,
                                       'name': 'TestLogicalSwitch1',
                                       'tenantId': 'Tenant1'}}
        
        This example shows how to send the call to the NSX Manager API by
        supplying the body dictionary in the call:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [16]: new_ls_response = client_session.create('logicalSwitches', 
                                                             uri_parameters={'scopeId': 
                                                                             'vdnscope-1'}, 
                                                             request_body_dict=new_ls)
        
            In [17]: client_session.view_response(new_ls_response)
            HTTP status code:
            201
        
            HTTP location header:
            /api/2.0/vdn/virtualwires/virtualwire-1305
        
            NSX Object Id:
            virtualwire-1305
        
            HTTP Body Content:
            'virtualwire-1305'
        
        Note on Etag header and additional headers (e.g. If-match)
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        
        Some resources in NSX Manager will additionally need the ``If-match``
        header. To compose the ``If-match`` header, retrieve the content of the
        Etag and return it in the ``If-match`` header. For example, this is used
        in the distributed firewall configuration to deal with conflicts when
        multiple users try to concurrently edit rule sets.
        
        This example shows how to retrieve a dfw rule, edit it, and update it
        via the NSX API:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            rule_read_response = client_session.read('dfwL3Rule', 
                                                     uri_parameters={'sectionId': section_id,
                                                                     'ruleId': new_rule_id})
            updated_rule = l3_dfw_rule_read_response['body']
            etag_value = l3_dfw_rule_read_response['Etag']
        
            updated_rule['rule']['name'] = 'UpdatedByRAMLClient'
        
            update_response = client_session.update('dfwL3Rule', 
                                                    uri_parameters={'sectionId': section_id,
                                                                    'ruleId': rule_id},
                                                    additional_headers={'If-match': etag_value},
                                                    request_body_dict=updated_rule)
        
        Note that the ``If-match`` header is supplied by the
        ``additional_headers`` dictionary.
        
        Note on the use of XML Tags in body schemas
        -------------------------------------------
        
        Some resources in NSX expect values to be set in XML Tags. This example
        shows a dfw resource:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [18]: client_session.view_resource_body_example('dfwL3Rules', 'create')
            <rule disabled="false" logged="false">
                <name>AddRuleTest</name>
                <action>allow</action>
                <notes/>
            .... truncated for brevity ....
        
        The ``rule``\ has the Tags ``disabled`` and ``logged``. When this type
        of Tag is found, it is converted to a key prefixed by ``@`` in the
        resulting dictionary:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [19]: l3rule = client_session.extract_resource_body_example('dfwL3Rules', 
                                                                          'create')
            In [20]: client_session.view_body_dict(l3rule)
            {'rule': {'@disabled': 'false',
                      '@logged': 'false',
                      'action': 'allow',
            .... truncated for brevity ....
        
        It is possible to set values using the ``@`` prefix, and they will be
        converted to a XML Tag of the top level object.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            l3section_bdict['section']['rule'][0]['@logged'] = 'true'
        
        Note on repeating key/value pairs and resulting python lists containing dicts
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        In some cases NSX uses lists of parameters with repeating keys. For
        example:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [21]: client_session.view_resource_body_example('dfwL3Section', 'create')
            <section name="Test">
                <rule disabled="false" logged="true">
                    <name/>
                    <action>ALLOW</action>
                    <appliedToList>
                        <appliedTo>
                            <name/>
                            <value/>
                            <type/>
                            <isValid/>
                        </appliedTo>
                    </appliedToList>
                    <sources excluded="false">
                        <source>
                            <name/>
                            <value/>
                            <type/>
                            <isValid/>
                        </source>
                        <source>
                            <name/>
                            <value/>
                            <type/>
                            <isValid/>
                        </source>
                    </sources>
                    <destinations excluded="false">
                        <destination>
                            <name/>
                            <value/>
                            <type/>
                            <isValid/>
                        </destination>
                        <destination>
                            <name/>
                            <value/>
                            <type/>
                            <isValid/>
                        </destination>
                    </destinations>
                    <services>
                        <service>
                            <destinationPort/>
                            <protocol/>
                            <subProtocol/>
                        </service>
                    </services>
                </rule>
                <rule disabled="false" logged="true">
                   <name/>
                   <action>DENY</action>
                </rule>
            </section>
        
        There are multiple ``destination`` keys under ``destinations``. To be
        able to work with python dictionaries, nsxramlclient will convert those
        list of equally named parameter 'groups' to a Python list containing
        dictionaries. This example shows the resulting Python dictionary for
        this type of resource body schema:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [22]: dfw_l3_sec = client_session.extract_resource_body_example('dfwL3Section', 
                                                                              'create')
            In [31]: client_session.view_body_dict(dfw_l3_sec)
            {'section': {'@name': 'Test',
                         'rule': [{'@disabled': 'false',

                                                                     'type': None,

        Note the ``rule`` key, its value is a python List containing multiple
        rule objects that themselves are python dictionaries. The same holds
        true for the ``destinations``\ and ``sources`` keys.
